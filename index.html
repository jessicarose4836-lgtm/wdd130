                <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my web development portfolio page! My name is Jessica Snedecor, I am a student at BYU-Idaho and am beginning my exploration and journey into the world of website development. To build a foundation for my understanding and skills in this field, I took WDD 130, a web fundamentals class offered at BYU-Idaho. Prior to this class, I didn't have much experience at all with HTML or CSS, the two main components of this class, so it was difficult for me to quickly or efficiently apply what was learned in class. Though, as time went on, I began to improve my skills, until eventually, I made this portfolio page to showcase everything I created over the course of the semester. Some of the projects are complete and look great, and some of them are far from finished, but they all played a great role in my learning and journey into the wonderful world of website design and creation.</p>

                <h2>In Class Exercise</h2>
                <p>Various In-Class-Exercises (ICE Challenges) were designed to be completed in less than an hour. The task was to work and accomplish as much as possible within the class time limit and complete whatever the final product was, completed or otherwise. Each task was curated to challenge and improve skills in specific areas of web design and creation, such as positioning, form building, and image editing, to name a few. These challenges greatly improved my understanding and proficiency, even if the road toward that understanding was fairly bumpy.</p>
