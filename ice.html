                    <h2>Apostle Spotlight Challenge</h2>
                    <P>The Apostle Spotlight challenge was to create a simple page with gallery style photos of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The photos were to be circular and have a thick, white border. Meanwhile, the background was to be a picture of the Christus statue, with the beautiful blue mural behind it to fill in the rest of the space. While working on this challenge, I learned how to use the border-radius and background-image functions in CSS.</P>

                    <h2>Favorite Devotional Challenge</h2>
                    <P>The Favorite Devotional challenge was to create a simple table containing your 3 favorite devotionals. Information included in the table was speaker, title, location, and year. Then, below the table, was to be a short form for a user to then enter the information for their own favorite devotional, though I was unable to finish this part. While working on this challenge, I learned how to make and style both tables and forms.</P>

                    <h2>Gallery Challenge</h2>
                    <P>The Gallery challenge was to create an art gallery filled with pictures of Christ that once clicked on, opened a new tab with an enlarged version of the image. In order to do this, I needed to shrink the originally large image files down into smaller sizes and less storage with an online photo editor. While working on this challenge, I learned how to use a photo editor and change image file sizes.</P>

                    <h2>Halloween Challenge</h2>
                    <P>The Halloween challenge was to take prewritten HTML and style it as best you could with CSS without changing the HTML, using your own creativity and imagination. With no wireframe to follow, this challenge was a bit more difficult for me, since I had no visual reference. While working on this challenge, I learned how to animate an image and add a shadow to text, making it look as though it is glowing.</P>

This was a fairly easy challenge, and I felt like it solidified my understanding of grid styling.

Nelson, including their name, role, picture, birth date, date of ordination to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and calling of the Prophet, and finally one quote. While working on this challenge, I learned how to use basic HTML and CSS to follow a simple wireframe design, particularly, how to make a list.</P>
